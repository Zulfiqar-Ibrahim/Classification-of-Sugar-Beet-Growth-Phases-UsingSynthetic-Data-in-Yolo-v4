# Classification-of-Sugar-Beet-Growth-Phases-UsingSynthetic-Data-in-Yolo-v4
In  this  project,  classification  system  has  predicteddifferent  growth  phases  of  synthetic  images  of  sugar  beet  usingstate  of  an  art,  real-time  object  detection  model  (Yolo  v4).  Toachieve this task, Blender is used for the creation of sugar beetâ€™s3D  models  and  Unreal  Engine  4  for  the  simulation  in  different environments. 

There are four types of 3D models according to their growth phase which is then placed in a simulated environment in Unreal Engine for the acquisition of images.
Unreal engine is used to simulate a farm-like environment for acquisition training images. This training data is used for the
training and validation process for Yolo net. In the end, 3D models of sugar beet in a simulated environment have produced
substantial results which proved that synthetic data can be used for real-life application of object detection.
