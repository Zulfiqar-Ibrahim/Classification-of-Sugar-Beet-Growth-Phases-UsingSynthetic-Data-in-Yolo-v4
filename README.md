# Classification-of-Sugar-Beet-Growth-Phases-UsingSynthetic-Data-in-Yolo-v4
In  this  project,  classification  system  has  predicteddifferent  growth  phases  of  synthetic  images  of  sugar  beet  usingstate  of  an  art,  real-time  object  detection  model  (Yolo  v4).  Toachieve this task, Blender is used for the creation of sugar beetâ€™s3D  models  and  Unreal  Engine  4  for  the  simulation  in  differentenvironments.
